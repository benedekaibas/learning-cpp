## Core C++ Concepts

### Basic Syntax and Semantics:
- Variables, data types, and operators ✅
- Control structures (if, switch, loops) ✅
- Functions (declaration, definition, parameters, return values) ✅
- Pointers and references ✅

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
- Classes and objects ✅
- Constructors and destructors ✅
- Inheritance (basic understanding)
- Polymorphism (virtual functions)
- Encapsulation and abstraction

### Memory Management:
- Dynamic memory allocation (new, delete)
- Basic understanding of smart pointers (unique_ptr, shared_ptr)

### Standard Template Library (STL):
- Common containers (vector, list, map, set)
- Iterators
- Basic algorithms (sort, find)

### Basic C++11/14 Features:
- auto keyword
- Range-based for loops
- nullptr

## Problem-Solving Skills

### Data Structures:
- Arrays and strings ✅
- Linked lists
- Stacks and queues
- Basic understanding of trees and graphs

### Algorithms:
- Sorting algorithms (bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort)
- Searching algorithms (linear search, binary search)
- Basic recursion

### Complexity Analysis:
- Basic understanding of time and space complexity (Big O notation)

## Practical Skills

### Coding Practice:
- Solve problems on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, Codeforces, etc. ✅
- Practice writing clean and efficient code ✅

### Debugging and Testing:
- Basic debugging techniques ✅
- Writing simple test cases ✅

## Soft Skills

### Communication:
- Explain your thought process clearly ✅
- Ask clarifying questions ✅
- Discuss trade-offs and alternative solutions ✅

### Problem-Solving Approach:
- Break down the problem into smaller parts ✅
- Write pseudocode before actual implementation ✅
- Optimize the solution iteratively ✅
