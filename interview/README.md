# 🧠 C++ Junior Interview Preparation

This repository is a **comprehensive collection of C++ interview questions and concepts** commonly asked for **junior-level software engineering positions**.  
It covers both **fundamentals and modern C++ features**, helping you prepare effectively for real-world technical interviews.

---

## 📘 Overview

This repository is designed to help you:
- Understand **core C++ language concepts**  
- Prepare for **entry-level and internship interviews**  
- Review **modern C++ (C++11–C++20)** features  
- Practice with **hands-on coding challenges**

Whether you’re preparing for a **systems**, **embedded**, or **application development** role, this collection gives you a solid base of what interviewers expect.

## 🧩 Topics Covered

### 1. Core Language Fundamentals
- Syntax, variables, and types  
- Control structures (`if`, `switch`, `for`, etc.)  
- Namespaces and `const` usage  

### 2. Object-Oriented Programming
- Classes and structs  
- Constructors, destructors, and copy semantics  
- Inheritance, polymorphism, and virtual functions  
- The “Rule of Three / Five / Zero”

### 3. Memory Management
- Pointers vs. references  
- `new` / `delete` vs. `malloc` / `free`  
- Smart pointers (`unique_ptr`, `shared_ptr`, `weak_ptr`)  
- Avoiding memory leaks and dangling pointers  

### 4. Standard Template Library (STL)
- Containers (`vector`, `map`, `unordered_map`, `list`, `deque`)  
- Iterators and algorithms  
- Complexity considerations  

### 5. Modern C++ (C++11 and beyond)
- Move semantics  
- Lambdas and `auto`  
- `constexpr` and `decltype`  
- Rvalue references and range-based loops  

### 6. Compilation & Linking
- Preprocessing, compilation, assembly, and linking stages  
- Header files and include guards  
- One Definition Rule (ODR)  

### 7. Common Pitfalls & Debugging
- Undefined behavior  
- Shallow vs. deep copies  
- Segmentation faults and memory corruption  

### 8. Multithreading Basics
- Threads, mutexes, and race conditions  
- Deadlocks and synchronization  

### 9. Coding Practice
- Reverse a string  
- Implement a custom `unique_ptr`  
- Count word occurrences using `std::map`  
- Design a class using RAII principles  

### 10. Soft & Conceptual Questions
- Debugging real-world issues  
- Preferred tools and workflow  
- Efficiency and maintainability in C++ projects
