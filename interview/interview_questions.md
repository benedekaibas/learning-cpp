---

## 2. 🧩 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

### Classes & Objects
- Explain the concept of encapsulation.
- What is the difference between a class and a struct in C++?
- What is a constructor? What is a copy constructor?
- When is a destructor called?

### Inheritance & Polymorphism
- What is the difference between public, protected, and private inheritance?
- What is virtual inheritance and why might it be used?
- What is the “diamond problem” in C++?
- What is the difference between compile-time and run-time polymorphism?

### Common Patterns
- What does the “Rule of Three/Five/Zero” mean?
- Why do we use virtual destructors?
- What is object slicing?

## 3. ⚙️ Memory Management

### Pointers & References
- What’s the difference between a pointer and a reference?
- What happens if you `delete` the same pointer twice?
- How can you avoid memory leaks?

### Dynamic Allocation
- How do `new` and `delete` differ from `malloc` and `free`?
- What happens if `new` fails to allocate memory?

### Smart Pointers (C++11+)
- What are `unique_ptr`, `shared_ptr`, and `weak_ptr`?
- How does `shared_ptr` manage reference counting?

---

## 4. 🧱 Standard Template Library (STL) and Containers

### Containers
- Difference between `std::vector`, `std::list`, and `std::deque`?
- What is the time complexity of inserting an element into a vector?
- How does `std::map` differ from `std::unordered_map`?

### Iterators & Algorithms
- What is an iterator?
- How do you use `std::find`, `std::sort`, or `std::for_each`?
- What’s the difference between `begin()` / `end()` and `cbegin()` / `cend()`?

---

## 5. 🔧 Modern C++ (C++11 and Beyond)

### Features
- What are move constructors and move assignment operators?
- Explain the difference between `auto` and `decltype`.
- What are lambda expressions? Give an example.
- What is `constexpr`?
- What is the difference between rvalue and lvalue references?
- What are range-based for loops?

---

## 6. 🧩 Compilation & Linking

- What happens during each stage: preprocessing, compilation, assembly, linking?
- What is a header file? What is an include guard?
- What is the One Definition Rule (ODR)?
- What’s the difference between static and dynamic linking?

---

## 7. 🧠 Common Pitfalls & Debugging

- What causes a segmentation fault?
- What is undefined behavior? Give examples.
- What is the difference between shallow and deep copy?
- What are dangling pointers?

---

## 8. 🧮 Multithreading (Basic Awareness)

- What is a race condition?
- What is a mutex?
- How does `std::thread` work?
- What is a deadlock and how can you prevent it?

---

## 9. 🧰 Practical / Coding Questions

- Reverse a string in place.
- Implement your own version of `unique_ptr`.
- Write a class that manages a dynamic array safely (RAII).
- Find the maximum element in a vector.
- Count word occurrences using `std::map`.

---

## 10. 💬 Conceptual / Soft Questions

- What C++ project have you worked on?
- How do you debug a segmentation fault?
- What IDE, build system, or tools do you prefer?
- What’s the hardest bug you’ve fixed?
- How do you ensure your code is efficient and maintainable?
